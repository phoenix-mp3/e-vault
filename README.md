# Blockchain-based eVault for Legal Records

The **eVault** system is designed for secure and efficient legal records management using blockchain technology. It leverages MetaMask for cryptocurrency transactions, ensuring robust user authentication and document handling. This platform provides a user-friendly React-based dashboard for accessing, searching, and managing legal documents with enhanced security features.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The eVault system addresses the limitations of traditional centralized systems by integrating blockchain for decentralized identity management and document verification. It includes:

- **MetaMask Integration:** Facilitates Ethereum-based transactions and interactions with decentralized applications (DApps).
- **User Dashboard:** A React-developed interface providing an overview and management of legal records.
- **Access Control & Encryption:** Implements role-based access control (RBAC) and end-to-end encryption to safeguard data.
- **Document Verification:** Allows viewing of verified documents with detailed verification steps and version history.

## ðŸ”§ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Web3, Solidity, IPFS, Truffle.
- **Front End:** React JS, Bootstrap.
- **Back End:** NodeJS.
- **Database:** MongoDB.
- **Hosting Services:** Heroku (React DApp), MLAB (MongoDB), Infura (Blockchain), MetaMask.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup
